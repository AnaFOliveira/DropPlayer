# DropPlayer
SQL database and MediaPlayer App

This project was made for the Database and Information Analysis course, where we were 
responsible for creating an app with a simple interface using Python and SQL (PostgreSQL). 
This app works similarly to a music guide (such as AllMusic.com archive), with a music-share
feature between users, just like Dropbox. In this way, the user could search for information 
related to a song/album/band, just like its authors, albums, bands, concerts, lyrics, etc., 
upload his own files, create playlists and share them with other users.


This project was made in collaboration with Adriana Cunha, user TheAdriItMe.
